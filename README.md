Football Web Scraping Project

Overview:
This project is designed to scrape detailed football match data from various online sources and use this data to predict match outcomes using machine learning models. The project consists of data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and prediction stages, organized into different scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

Project Structure:
matches.csv              # CSV file containing the scraped football match data
scraping.ipynb           # Jupyter notebook for web scraping
prediction.ipynb         # Jupyter notebook for data analysis and prediction
README.md                # This file

a) matches.csv: The dataset containing the scraped football match data.
    Key Columns:
    Date: The date when the match took place.
    Home Team: The name of the home team.
    Away Team: The name of the away team.
    Home Score: The number of goals scored by the home team.
    Away Score: The number of goals scored by the away team.
    Result: The outcome of the match (Win/Draw/Loss for the home team).
    Possession, Shots on Target, Corners, etc.: Additional statistics related to the match.
    
b) scraping.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that contains the web scraping code. This notebook extracts data such as match results, team statistics, and player performances from the web and     compiles it into a structured format.
   Key Components:
   Web Scraping Setup: Initialization of scraping parameters, including the URLs to be scraped and the data fields to be extracted.
   Data Extraction: Code that navigates through HTML structures to locate and extract relevant match data.
   Data Cleaning: Procedures for cleaning and formatting the extracted data, such as handling missing values, converting data types, and standardizing column names.
   Data Storage: The cleaned data is saved to matches.csv for later use in analysis and prediction.

c) prediction.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook dedicated to building and evaluating predictive models based on the scraped data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation steps.
    Key Components:
    Data Loading: Code to load the dataset from matches.csv and perform initial explorations, such as summary statistics and data visualization.
    Feature Engineering: Creation of new features that may improve model performance, such as calculating goal differences, home advantage indicators, and historical performance metrics.
    Model Training: Training different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the processed data. The notebook includes hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
    Model Evaluation: Assessment of the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics. The notebook also includes visualizations of the models' performance, such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
    Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the outcomes of future matches.

Requirements:
Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries:
    requests: For sending HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
    BeautifulSoup4: For parsing HTML and XML documents.
    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    numpy: For numerical operations.
    scikit-learn: For machine learning model building.
